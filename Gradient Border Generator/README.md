# Generator of the Gradient Border Blocks

The Generator is used for generating Gradient Borders for elements.
There are two types of the Gradient Border: which have Border Radius, the others haven't.
For generating the styles you should do these steps:
- Choose count of the colors (assets/images/img1.png),
- Select colors from Color picker (assets/images/img2.png),
- Type degree of the colors (assets/images/img3.png),
- Click Generate button (assets/images/img4.png),
- Copy generated styles (assets/images/img5.png),
- Enjoy!

Note: the background color of the blocks, which have border radius, default is white. For changing it, change linear-gradient(white, white) to your block background color.

Note: In the video the alert and color picker isn't showing.
